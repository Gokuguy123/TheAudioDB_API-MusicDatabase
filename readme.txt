Do you have an extensive music collection? Do you find it difficult to keep up with what albums/songs you own? If you're looking for a solution that can help you keep track of what you have AND give you suggestions for your next addition to the collection, this project may be of interest to you.

This project utilizes free API requests through "TheAudioDB", a community-driven audio database, to pull discographies of artists you enjoy into a local database. From here, you can flag albums and singles you own in the format that you own (Digital, CD, Vinyl-33, Vinyl-45, Casette, 8-Track), and when you added it to the collection. 

From here, you should be able to answer any questions you may have about your current collection, or the future of your collection! 
	"I forget, did I get that album or this one?" 
	"How many albums did I add to my collection last year?" 
	"Do I have every album from this artist to-date?"

Some may ask why wouldn't you keep this all in a spreadsheet, or something simpler to add to in the future. I have a couple reasons: 
	1) I'm a Data Warehouse Developer, looking to expand my expertise and hone various skills with projects like this.
	2) I do not wish to be confined to the front-end experience of Excel-like products.

Excel is a powerful tool in its own right, but I'm looking to create my own front-end experience by the end of this project. Initially, queries and flagging will need to be done through the use of SQL Server, but once this project matures, the plan is to expand this to run within its own application, allowing a user to build their own collection through its own front-end experience and simplify search and update options.

My inspiration for this project actually comes from my wife. She has an extensive vinyl collection, much larger than I'm able to keep up with! I've gotten her music she already owns on more than one occasion... She loves getting new additions to her collection, but lets be honest. No one is trilled to get an album they've already gotten themselves the year before. 

She was sweet enough to make me a list (on paper) of everything in her collection this past year. It obviously helped when Christmas came around, but you can probably imagine how cumbersome it was to go through an unsorted list of the albums she has... Flipping through several pages of entries, scanning for anything by the artist I was looking at, just to make sure I didn't get another failure of a gift.

This project is dedicated to her. With this, I will (hopefully) never make that mistake again. Once this is complete, I should be able to query against the list for albums to avoid, as well as albums that would be better options as gifts for her.
